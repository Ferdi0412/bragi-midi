Bragi-midi
--------------------
Bragi is the Norse god for music. This project will provide a C++ library for MIDI and Python bindings for it. It is built primarily for me to practice using tools such as cmake, meson, building Python wrappers for C++ code, documenting using Sphinx and Doxygen, and publishing PyPi and Read the Docs.

It is reliant on the various system APIs and drivers, such as the **Windows MultiMedia API** for Windows.

Windows
--------------------
This project is developed on a Windows computer, Linux implementations *may* follow. See [Windows Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/multimedia/about-midi) for more info.
